            <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2023</h2>
            <p>As an NSU graduate, I can assure you that this amazing school has changed my life.  
                I stand before you today as a product of the good faith and encouragement of countless professional staff, faculty members, 
                and my peers who have become my NSU family.  I have been amazed at the love I have received and the knowledge that I have gained that far transcends the classroom.
                The opportunities that I have been given at NSU are more than I could have ever imagined. 
                I have not only been allowed the opportunity to see the world anew but I’ve been shown how important it is to do my part in changing the world for the better. 
                At NSU, I have created relationships and participated in the dialog that will forever change and inspire my life.<br><br>
                Thank you to the teachers and staff, and to the NorthSea University of Kuala Lumpur Malaysia for this amazing experience and education.  
                To my amazing Class of 2022, ANY person can make a difference, ANY person can spark a positive change and ANY person can ignite a fire that can illuminate the world. 
                 All it takes is FAITH and COURAGE and most of all DREAMING BIG with the help of our Lord Jesus Christ!”
