                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Foundation Programme is a one-year pre-university qualification designed to prepare SPM
                         students and O-Levels equivalents for undergraduate studies at NSU.<br><br>
                         Various courses (subjects) will enhance your academic knowledge, expose you to the latest developments in the respective areas of study and foster your
                          critical thinking skills. Simultaneously, it also sharpens students' presentation skills and English language professionally.

                    <ul type="disc">
                        <li>You will learn the courses that are <b>related to the undergraduate program</b> of your choice at NSU.</li>
                        <li>It offers the shortest for you to progress into the undergraduate program within 1 year. With the flexible program structure, 
                            you may complete your Foundation program at your desired pace of up to 2 years. </li>
                        <li>The assessment is more variety which usually a combination of coursework, continuous assessment, 
                            project and final examination (but the assessment methods and weighting are different from course to course). </li>
                        <li>Foundation students can experience the campus learning environment before your undergraduate programme.</li>
                        <li>There are three intakes in a year, i.e. January, April, and September. You can decide to enroll in the intake when you are ready to start your education journey at NSU. </li>

                    <h3 id="h3foundation">Is this Programme for me?</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">You should consider the Foundation programme if you already know the field of undergraduate study. The Foundation programme will provide you with solid 
                        knowledge and learning skills essential to meet the challenges of your preferred degree.
                        <br><br>
                        However, we design the Foundation programmes so that most skills are transferable to other fields of study. This will keep your option open and gain entry into other degree programmes (subject to meeting the programme entry requirements). 
                        This open option is important as many SPM and O-level students can only confirm or change their choice after they have completed their Foundation programmes.
